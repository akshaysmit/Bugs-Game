Created in March, 2017. There are no known issues, all functionality mentioned in the documentation has been implemented. The objects in the game are found in the Actor.h and Actor.cpp file. All actors and Bugs! compilers are maintained in StudentWorld.h and StudentWorld.cpp .

This requires XQuartz and freeGLUT on a Mac OS X, and OpenGL and freeGLUT on Linux. On a Mac OS X, it is simplest to use Xcode.

Instructions to run the game:

1. In main.cpp, change the assetDirectory variable initialization to the correct location of the DerivedData/Bugs/Build/Products/Debug/Assets directory
2. Write one or more Bugs! programs. Write a field file. To see how to do this, see the documentation pdf file
3. Run the game by passing the field file, followed by the Bugs! programs as consecutive command line arguments (up to 4 Bugs! programs)
