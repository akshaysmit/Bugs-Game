Created in March, 2017. This requires XQuartz and freeGLUT on a Mac OS X, and OpenGL and freeGLUT on Linux. On a Mac OS X, it is simplest to use Xcode.

Instructions to run the game:

1. In main.cpp, change the assetDirectory variable initialization to the correct location of the DerivedData/Bugs/Build/Products/Debug/Assets directory
2. Write one or more Bugs! programs. Write a field file. To see how to do this, see the documentation pdf file
3. Run the game by passing the field file, followed by the Bugs! programs as consecutive command line arguments (up to 4 Bugs! programs)
